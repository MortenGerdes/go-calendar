# mcal
A simple script for printing out today's events from macOS Calendar app.
The code was shamelessly stolen from [here](https://github.com/0ihsan/mcal/tree/master), rewritten a bit and deleted all the unnecessary stuff.

## install
```
swiftc mcal.swift -o /usr/local/bin/mcal
```
## usage
`mcal list`
